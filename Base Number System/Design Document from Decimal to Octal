1. We will start by initializing an array, to store the outputs of the remainder through division.

2. Next, we will create a while loop, which will divide the input integer by 8, 

3. And keep dividing the quotient by 8, and update the loop until the quotient is 0.

4. We will also store the remainder at every step in the initialized array at index which we will keep incrementing for each iteration of the while loop.

5. We can then print the array using a for loop.
