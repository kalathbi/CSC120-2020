1. We will start by initializing an array, to store the outputs of the quotients through division.

2. Next, we will create a while loop, which will divide the input integer by 8, 

3. And keep dividing the reminder by 8, and update the loop until the remainder is 0.

4. We will also store the quotient at every step in the initialized array at index which we will keep incrementing for each iteration of the while loop.

5. We can then print the array using a for loop.
